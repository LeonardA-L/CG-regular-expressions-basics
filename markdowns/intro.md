# Introduction
A regular expression (or the acronym "regex") is a pattern that allows complex text searches. 
Imagine you need to search email addresses on a given text. An email address has a complex structure: it has an account part, the @ sign and the domain name part, and each part has it's own restrictions. This is a hard task to do if you try to program it as usual, with loops, simple text searches and conditionals.

Instead of that, let's try to search email addresses with a regular expression. 
In the example below, there is a code with an email regex pattern. To test it, press "RUN MY CODE".

#### Example - Searching E-mail addresses

If you click on the "View Validators" button you'll see what it's matching on each validator, highlighted with a color.

As you see, a regex pattern is a very powerful tool. It's used on a lot of different fields and programs.
In this course you'll learn the basics of regex, enough to understand a regex pattern, and creating yours.
